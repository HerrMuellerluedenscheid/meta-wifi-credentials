II. Misc
========

This layer contains demo recipes used at SCALE 17 to show how to add WiFi
credentials and network management utilities in OpenEmbedded builds.

Note that WiFi passwords are stored directly in this repo which is visible
publicly on github.com so this should not be used directly but rather serve
as a guide for how to setup a private layer for yourself.
